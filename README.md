# Pwn

Tooling for hacking in Elixir.

## Installation

Pwn is not yet published. When it is, you'll be able to add it to your project
as:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:pwn, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

For now, though, if you want some pwn tools, pull in this dependency in git:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:pwn, git: "git@github.com:the-mikedavis/pwn.git"}
  ]
end
```
